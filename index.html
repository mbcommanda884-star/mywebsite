            <p>
                Hello, I'm Marybeth Commanda! I'm new to this program and I'm excited to learn more. I'm passionate about learning new things and exploring new goals and opportunities. I also love to spend my time fishing and spending quality time with my kiddo. This website is a small glimpse into my world and what I'm working on.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey in this course is to learn new skills and maybe further them in a future job title. So far I've been dedicated to learning and growing my skills in this field. I believe that by the end of the course I will leave with new skills and be able to create an official website that can be useful to others.
            </p>
