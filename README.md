# My Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This project showcases my skills, interests, and journey as I learn and grow in the field of web development.

## Project Overview

This portfolio consists of three main files:

1. **index.html**: This file contains the HTML structure of the personal portfolio website. It includes:
   - A header with a welcome message.
   - A main section with an "About Me" section and a "My Skills & Interests" section.
   - A footer with copyright information.

2. **style.css**: This file is intended for styling the HTML elements in the `index.html` file. It contains CSS rules to enhance the visual presentation of the portfolio.

3. **README.md**: This file provides documentation for the project, including an overview of the portfolio, instructions for viewing it, and any other relevant information.

## Instructions for Viewing

To view the portfolio, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You can do this by double-clicking the file or by right-clicking and selecting "Open with" followed by your preferred web browser.

## Future Improvements

As I continue to learn, I plan to enhance this portfolio by:
- Adding more sections to showcase additional projects.
- Improving the design with advanced CSS techniques.
- Implementing responsive design for better viewing on mobile devices.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
